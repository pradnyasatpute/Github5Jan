Oops Concept

1).Object
- Instance of a class
- Real World entity
- eg., table , pen , chair , bag , glass
- consumes space/memory
- it has states and behaviours
- logical or physical
- cat : states : color,name,breed   behaviours: running, eating , meow

- 3 ways to initialize object in java :
  1) By reference variable
  2) By method
  3) By constructor

2). Class
- template or blueprint for the objects
- collection of objects
- logical entity
- doesn't consume any space

3).Inheritance
- when an obj acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object
- provides code re-usability
- used to achieve runtime polymorphism
***- it represents Is-A relationship ***
eg.,
dog is a animal
doctor is a person
sparrow is a bird
cat is a animal
question :
class shape {
    double Calculatearea()

*Types of inheritance :
    1).single
   * 2).multiple  //not supported by java
    3).Hierarchical :   one Parent class and many child class

    4).multilevel
   * 5).hybrid // not supported by java
   //note: java doesn't support multiple and hybrid inheritance

4).polymorphism
- one task is performed in different ways
- eg., cat sounds meow,lion sounda roar and dog sounds woof

 Method Overloading :
            - name of the method is same but arguments / parameters are different
            eg.,
                void add(int a, int b )
                void add(int a, int b , int c )
                void add(int a, int b ,int c , int d)
                void add(int a, int b , Float c)
5).abstraction
- hiding internal details and showing functionality
eg., washing machine ..don't know internal processing

6).Encapsulation
- binding or wrapping of data and code together in a single unit(class)
- eg., capsule..wrapped with different medicines
eg.
    class Student{
        private int id;
        private String name;
    }
    advantages :
        -for security
        -




 *New keyword :
 - it is used to allocate memory at runtime in heap area

 **method :
    - to expose the behaviour of an object
    - advantages
    - code optimization          ##by using the method , we reduces the code
    - code re_usability              ## reuse the code
Explain PIE ?
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
